# Team JustForFun
Shopping mall is one of the main attractions of a city. Whether a city is considered smart or not therefore relies on the "smartness" of the shopping malls in the city. We, JustForFun primarily focus on shopping malls and try to solve problems that exist in everyone's everyday mall shopping experience. 
## Problems
- Customers spent too much time to look for available parking spaces.
- Customers face difficulties in searching for fashion outlets that suit their style.
- The current parking system lacks automation.
## Solution
- Online carpark reservation system. User can reserve carpark by providing their license plate number in the app. The camera system at the shopping mall's carpark analyzes customers' license plate number and opens up a special reserved area for the customer if he or she has made a reservation before coming.
- Fashion style recommendation. User can upload or take photo of any outfits by using the app. The system will then filter the outlets available based on the styles that they offer.
## Introducing our application - Shop Ranger
